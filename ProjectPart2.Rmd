# Introduction

Describe the underlying SFO data and research questions. (1-2 paragraphs)
## Part A
### Hypothesis/Hypotheses
Mention overall research questions posed by executives. Mention not just the analysis you will do, but any predicted outcomes you may have. (1-3 paragraphs, bullet points, etc)

#### Data Description/EDA
Start with a general overview of the data (sample size, important variables, etc); describe what you can about the variables needed to address the executivesâ€™ questions; provide a small number of tables or figures with EDA output relevant to your research. Mention any insights gleaned from EDA that altered your original hypothesis or changed your analysis approach.

#### Analysis plan
Detail the specific analyses that will address these research questions. (1-2 paragraphs, or numbered/bulleted list)

#### Results
Run models - but do not necessarily post all code chunks and all outputs. Organize and summarize the most crucial results. Describe the analytic results (regression coefficients, p-values, comparison of test error rates, interpretation of clusters, benefit of multiple imputation, interpretation of sentiment and topics, etc) of the various analyses you ran. Interpret the meaning of the result. (length open)

#### Discussion
Relate the results directly to the prompts posed by the SFO executives. Did you address the research questions? Did the results match your expectations, or did you find something different from you were expecting? What are the strengths of your chosen analysis, and what are the potential limitations of the method used or issues in the data?

# Part B
##Research Question and Hypothesis
Briefly describe your own general research question and specific hypothesis behind it.

#### EDA
Describe any key variabls for your research question that were not used in Part A, and/or summarize EDA findings from Part A.

#### Analysis Plan
Describe the method chosen to address your own research question and why.

#### Results
Same as descibed in Part A - summarize important results and how the chosen method is evaluated, and interpret findings.

#### Discussion
Relate results back to your broader research question.

# Appendix
Include here relevant codes and output that help you address the questions above.

If you have a massive Rmarkdown that is already knitted, you can include the appendix and summary write-up in separate documents.
